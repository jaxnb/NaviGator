navigator uses the /enu frame.
origin is where the robot starts.
Is up always north?
All i have to worry about is placing the satellite images correctly relative to the origin



1. make a py pkg to send lat, long and can move coords
2. make it publish a marker
3. see how map updates and how it centers and rewrites tiles

Get the aerial map display to load the tiles and not update their locations.

1 package to take lla data and load the tiles
1 package to simulate gps data through lla


Launch:
1. point_stamped_and_odom_to_navsatfix
2. aerial map display
3. rviz
